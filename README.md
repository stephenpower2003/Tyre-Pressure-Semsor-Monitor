# Tyre-Pressure-Sensor-Monitor

Arduino project created using Tinkercad software for an automotive software concepts module. 

The project consists of an Arduino Uno R3, a resistor, an LED and four temperature sensors. (Temperature sensors were used as Tinkercad does not have pressure sensors). The main application of this project consists of the LED light powering on if any of the temperature sensors are set to an irregular value. This is to replicate the system in a car where a warning light turns on whenever the sensors in the wheels of the car detect irregular tyre pressure.
